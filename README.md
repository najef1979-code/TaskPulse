##  Security

### Security Best Practices

1. **Change JWT Secret** - Generate a secure random string for production
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

2. **Use HTTPS** - Always use SSL/TLS in production
3. **Limit Bot Permissions** - Give bots only the permissions they need
4. **Regular Updates** - Keep dependencies up to date
5. **Database Backups** - Automate regular backups
6. **Monitor Logs** - Watch for suspicious activity

### Security Features

- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
- ✅ JWT-based authentication
- ✅ Secure session cookies (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
- ✅ Granular bot permissions
- ✅ Whitelisted bot access (restrict API to known IPs)
- ✅ Flexible human access (users can access from anywhere)
- ✅ SQL injection prevention
- ✅ XSS protection
